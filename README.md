# Caesar Cipher Python Implementation

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic **Caesar Cipher** encryption and decryption algorithm. Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest and most basic encryption techniques where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## 📌 Features
- Encrypt text using Caesar Cipher
- Decrypt text with the original shift key
- Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Ignores symbols, numbers, and punctuation (they remain unchanged)
- Interactive CLI (Command Line Interface)

## 🛠️ How It Works
Caesar Cipher replaces each letter in the plaintext by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:


To decrypt, shift in the opposite direction.

=== Caesar Cipher Tool ===
Do you want to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt? e
Enter your message: Hello, World!
Enter the shift amount (e.g. 3): 3

Encrypted message: Khoor, Zruog!

```
